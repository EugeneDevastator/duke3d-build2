You are free to do whatever you want with my textures as long as it's respectful to me, the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License terms and humanity in general. For more information, have fun reading the licence or contact me. ;)
Ok, basically you can modify and redistribute if you keep the licence and the copyright mention (to which you can add your name) along with your distributed package.

The custom water and lava animations are the creation of JohnSmith, you should see with him if you want to use them.
The font is a common effort mostly credited to its unknown original creator and to Misa.
