# Port of duke3d onto Build2
build 2 by Ken Silverman: https://www.advsys.net/ken/build.htm

## To see maps in engine you need:
- all .art files in folder with map
- palette.dat in same folder

## Plan:
- move all gameplay logic into .kc file, using evaldraw as main engine.
- update build engine to get duke data, like wall horisontal texture split, transparency, pal value etc.
